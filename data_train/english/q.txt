The list of Founders is often expanded to include the signers of the Declaration of Independence and individuals who later ratified the U.S. Constitution.[2] Meanwhile, some scholars regard all delegates to the Constitutional Convention as Founding Fathers whether they approved the Constitution or not.[17][18] In addition, some historians include signers of the Articles of Confederation, which was adopted in 1781 as the nation's first constitution.[19]
Beyond this, the criteria for inclusion varied. Historians with an expanded view of the list of Founding Fathers include Revolutionary War military leaders as well as participants in developments leading up to the war, including prominent writers, orators, and other men and women who contributed to the American Revolutionary cause.[20][4][21][22] Since the 19th century, some of the analysis has shifted from the concept of the Founders as demigods who created the modern nation-state to take into account contemporary concerns over the inability of the founding generation to quickly remedy issues such as slavery and the treatment of Native Americans.[23][24] More recently, other scholars of the American founding have suggested that the Founding Fathers' accomplishments and shortcomings be viewed within the context of their times.
